  <p><a href ="https://www.gunpolib.go.kr/#/" target= _blank title = "gunpolib">The Miami Marathon will take place on Sunday, September 8th.</a> The race starts at 7 a.m. at Civic Square with runners traveling to Miami Beach via the MacArthur Causeway.
  We'd like to inform you that in order to allow the runners to safely run the route, we are scheduled to close some roads.</p>
  <p>All runners are expected to be completely off the course by 2 p.m. Before then, however, most of the roads included in the route will be clear of cars, and the roads will gradually reopen once the runners pass through.
  If you need more detailed information for road closures, please visit our website at www.miamimarathon.com.</p> Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation, and we apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause you
